INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS (for upgrading see the UPGRADING file)

1. Copy all files to a webserver-accessible directory, e.g. http://yoursite.com/interleave/.

1a. (optional) For easy installation, typ "chmod 777 config/config.inc.php" in your installation directory.

2. Point your browser to the installation directory and follow the installation instructions.

2a. (if you did 1a) do a "chmod 500 config.inc.php" in your installation directory. (and a chown if you like)

3. Add a cron job to your machine to start the 2 housekeeping jobs: (this is an essential step but not needed if you're only testing)

	An example cron entry: (the cron user doesn't need to be root)
	
	# Interleave housekeeping
	0 8 * * *       /usr/bin/php /var/www/interleave/duedate-notify-cron.php [REPOS] [CRONPASS] 1> /dev/null 2> /dev/null
	* * * * *	/usr/bin/php /var/www/interleave/housekeeping.php [REPOS] [CRONPASS] 1> /dev/null 2> /dev/null

	This will send an e-mail notification at 8 AM and run housekeeping every minute. Entities wich will be mentioned are entities which have
	an alarm date set to `today`.

	The [REPOSNR] part resembles the repository number you'd like to send notifications for. 0 for the first, 
	reposnr=1 for the second and so on (equal to the values in your config file).

	Skip the "1> /dev/null 2> /dev/null" part if you'd like reports mailed to the user under which the crond job runs.

	You can edit the cron script password using the administration interface (change system values, cronpassword). It is 
	recommended you change this password regularly for it is transmitted in plain text.
	
4. READ THE ADMINISTRATION MANUAL! There are some variables which you must set!

5. Done. All settings can be modified using the 'administration' page.
